## 📈 Daily Progress Log

### October 17, 2025 - Day 2

**Time:** 08:30 UTC  
**Phase:** 1  
**Progress:** 35%

**Completed:**
1. **Tested Component 1 (Web Scraping Agents)**
   - Ran GitHub and Reddit scrapers
   - Discovered 48 automation loops
   - Saved to discoveries.json

2. **Built Component 2a (Feature Extraction Engine)**

   - TextAnalyzer: Keyword extraction, categorization, complexity detection
   - QualityScorer: Popularity, reputation, value estimation
   - FeatureExtractor: Main orchestrator
   - Processed all 48 loops in 2 seconds

3. **Built Component 2b (Heuristic Quality Scorer)**
   - Rule-based scoring with weighted features
   - Approval/rejection/review decisions
   - Confidence scoring
   - Reasoning explanations
   - Scored all 48 loops

4. **Built End-to-End Pipeline Orchestrator**
   - main.py: Coordinates all components
   - 4-step pipeline: Discovery → Features → Scoring → Filtering
   - Async support for performance
   - Statistics tracking
   - Completed full pipeline in 4.3 seconds

5. **Created Comprehensive Unit Test Suite**
